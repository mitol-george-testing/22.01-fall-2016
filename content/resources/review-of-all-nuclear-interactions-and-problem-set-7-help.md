**Description:** Students’ questions on the past month of material are taken and explained using more practical problem set questions. A numerical example of determining reactor criticality is shown using the AP-1000, and asking a simple question—“Will It Blend?” In other words, we take the full, real specification sheet for the AP-1000, homogenize it (perfectly mix all materials into one uniform blob), and use criticality relations to determine if it would still work. Numerical integration using Microsoft Excel is shown as a way to take real cross section data from the OECD JANIS database and plug it into our analytical formulae to solve the problem.
