**Description:** Ka-Yen’s lecture on how nuclear reactors work is expanded upon, to spend more time on advanced fission and fusion reactors. Lots of topics related to reactor operation are conceptually introduced—moderation, absorption, leakage, fast vs. thermal spectrum, breeding fuel, neutron poisons, and temperature/density feedback. This sets the stage for student control of the MIT reactor to come shortly.

**Instructor:** Michael Short
