**Description:** The concepts of solid angle (the 3D equivalent of angle) and counting rates/uncertainties are briefly introduced, before heading into the MIT Nuclear Reactor Lab to see a gamma spectrometer, and the capsule insertion/removal system to neutronically activate specimens in the reactor. Students bring in pieces of whatever they’d like to learn what is isotopically contained within.
