**Description:** Prof. Short uses all the concepts introduced thus far to introduce the study of nuclear materials and radiation damage – his field of study. The concept of ionizing radiation creating nuclear displacements, not just electron ionization, is introduced as the first event in radiation damage. The structural defects produced from these displacements are shown to cluster, move, and evolve, resulting in drastic changes to material properties. Key structural material properties and their formal definitions are introduced and demystified by watching a pair of Finnish scientists smash various items with a 50 ton hydraulic press.
