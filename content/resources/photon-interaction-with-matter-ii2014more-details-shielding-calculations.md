**Description:** More details of photon interactions are revealed, and a couple of mistakes from the previous day are corrected. The Klein-Nishina cross section is introduced to explain the angle-energy dependence of Compton scattering. A “from-scratch” gamma counting spectrum is created from the individual photon interactions.
