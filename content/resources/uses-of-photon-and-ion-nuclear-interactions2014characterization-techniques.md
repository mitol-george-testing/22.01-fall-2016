**Description:** The uses of photons and ions to probe and understand matter are shown as practical examples of what we’ve learned in the past couple of weeks: electron microscopy, positron annihilation spectroscopy, elemental identification, and surface analysis via Auger electron spectroscopy. Prof. Short illustrates some techniques with examples from his PhD and undergraduate research projects.

**Instructor:** Michael Short
