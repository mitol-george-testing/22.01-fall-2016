**Description:** As many simplifications as possible are made to the neutron transport equation to make it solvable. The board is turned into a rainbow mess of term-specific cancellations and simplifications to reduce the neutron transport equation into something that is almost analytically solvable by any undergraduate of math, physics, or engineering. Finally, the divergence theorem is used to transform an ugly surface integral into a simpler volume integral by introducing a diffusion relation. This makes the whole thing a linear, second-order differential equation.
