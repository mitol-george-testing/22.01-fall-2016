**Description:** After our discussion of the Chernobyl accident, MIT student Jake Hecla explains the accident in far more detail, and catalogs his recent trip to the Chernobyl site, the town of Pripyat, and the newly installed sarcophagus designed to contain the exploded nuclear plant. Tons of photos of Chernobyl in its current state are shown by Jake in the context of the accident.
