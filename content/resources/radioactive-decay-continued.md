**Description:** Some of the trickier aspects of radioactive decay and subsequent electronic transitions are introduced, such as characteristic x-ray emission, Auger electron emission, and competing modes of radioactive decay. The ability to perform elemental identification and mapping using these electronic transitions is described.
