**Description:** The concept of hormesis—a little bit of a bad thing can be good—is introduced and vigorously debated by the students. Tools to find peer-reviewed, primary sources of scientific knowledge are briefly introduced so the students can find high-quality sources of information for their arguments for or against hormesis. The debate somewhat unpredictably does not end in a definitive conclusion, simply because there are enough high quality studies such that one side cannot disprove the other.
