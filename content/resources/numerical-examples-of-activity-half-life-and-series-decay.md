**Description:** A few example problems are posed and solved together as a class, to illustrate the theoretical topics presented in the last few lectures. Cross sections are reintroduced and incorporated into _nuclear reaction rates_, so they can be plugged into the series radioactive decay equations. 

**Instructor:** Michael Short
