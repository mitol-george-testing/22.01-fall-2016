**Description:** One simplified Q-equation is given in elastic neutron scattering, a Q = 0 reaction where one particle simply bounces off the other. We derive the relation between the energies of the incoming and outgoing neutron energies, and use this to explain what makes a good moderator (slowing-down material) for nuclear reactors. Here we link the energy dependence of cross sections with our Q-equation result to begin designing which materials should be used to construct a nuclear reactor.
