**Description:** We introduce the Q-equation, which describes any reaction between any two particles which releases or absorbs energy via any nuclear process. All two-body nuclear reactions will then derive from this as simplifications. We drill how the change in mass is the change in energy, given by ‘Q,’ the amount of mass-energy converted.
